At this point, I'm just trying my hand at solving some problems in Python and
Ruby.  I'm using Python3.  If I can get as fluent with Ruby as I am in
Python, that would be great, and I'm thinking this project will help.  Right now
I'm just doing the first 10 problems in Python, and I'm working on catching up
in Ruby.
